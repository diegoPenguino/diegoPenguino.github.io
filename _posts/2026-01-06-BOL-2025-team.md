I usually start the year by writing some post talking about how the year went, the good and the bad, and what to expect for the next year. However, this time I wanted to flip the script a little bit.

## A little bit of context

As many of you know, **I have competed in the IOI in 2015 and 2017**, representing Bolivia. Later on, in 2019, I had the amazing opportunity to be part of the organizing committee of the Bolivian Olympiad in Informatics, creating problems, training students, and helping with logistics.

In 2023, I had the chance to be **the team leader for Bolivia at the IOI in Szeged, Hu**ngary. I must say it was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life. Not only to travel with my team, but also to see their growth, their dedication, and their passion for informatics. Of course besides of all the amazing people you get to meet being part of the IOI community as a team leader.

In 2024 I returned as team leader for Bolivia at the **IOI in Alexandria, Egypt**. Once again, amazing experience, with new challenges and new opportunities to learn and grow.

But 2025, well, **2025 was different**.<br>
In 2025, again I was the team leader for Bolivia at the IOI, but this time, **IOI was held in Bolivia**, in my home country. So, I felt the necessity to perform and train the team at a higher level than ever before.

## 2025 was a tough year.

I don't want to go into details of my personal life throughout 2025, but it was a tough year. I had to deal with many challenges, both personal and physical. Of course all of this affected my ability to train the team as much as I wanted to.<br>
I feel like I let the team down in some aspects, and for that, **I am truly sorry**.<br>
But despite all the difficulties, I believe we did a great job. **The team worked hard**, and they showed how much they cared about representing Bolivia at home.

For the only time in IOI history, Bolivia had the chance to host the event. **Meaning we had the chance to have 2 teams representing the country**.<br>
Meaning the challenge was bigger, we had to train more students, and prepare them for the competition.

The first team was no surprise I believe, the same 4 students that had represented Bolivia in the last 2 IOIs. They were experienced, talented, and motivated. So, I knew they would do well, I saw them prepare for years, and I never felt like they did not care for the competition.<br>
These 4 kids, at all times, made me proud. They have been through some difficult stuff, and as every other teenager, they have their ups and downs.
But **they never gave up**, they always kept pushing forward, and they always tried to do their best. **I am really proud of them**, not only for their performance at the IOI, but for the people they are becoming.<br>

These 4 kids are not only my students, but I consider them my friends. **I have learned a lot from them**, and I hope they have learned something from me too.

The second team was not a huge surprise, but it was surprising to see how they performed. These 4 students were not as experienced as the first team, but I can assure, **the 4 of them could have been in the first team without any problem**.<br>

I had the chance to meet most of them for the first time during the national olympiad selection process. And I always saw potential in them. They were always enthusiastic, eager to learn, and willing to work hard.<br>

With apologies to other teams Bolivia has sent to the IOI in the past, I can say without any doubt that **the 2025 Bolivian IOI team was the strongest team Bolivia has ever sent to the IOI**. Not only because of their results, but because of their attitude, their dedication, and their passion.

I don't wish to extend much more, but I want to mention 2 things:

- First, this was supposed to be my last year as team leader for Bolivia at the IOI. I have been doing this for a while now, and I feel like it's time for me to step down and let someone else take the lead. However, **I have decided to stay** as long as the Bolivian Olympiad in Informatics won't kick me out (This is a joke, of course). <br> This decision is in part thanks to the great support the international community has given me throughout this IOI, your words and encouragement have meant a lot to me.<br> But mainly **this is for you guys**, the students. I feel like I still have a lot to give, and **I want to help you reach your full potential**. <br> So believe me when I say, I am staying as long as this team needs me, and as long as I can give my best to you.
- Second, I want to thank you all for being part of this journey. I know it hasn't been easy, but I hope you have enjoyed it as much as I have. I hope you have learned something, not only about informatics, but about life in general. <br> **I hope you have made some friends**, and that you have created some memories that will last a lifetime. <br> And most importantly, I hope you have had fun. <br> This olympiad, these competitions, are really difficult, but they are amazing experiences that will shape you as a person. <br> So **thank you for being part of this journey**, and thank you for all the effort you have put into it.

## Final words

This post replaces my annual reflection, because this year, **you 8 have been the best thing that happened to me**.<br>
This year, I can not be more proud of my team, and I can not be more grateful for having the chance to be part of your journey.<br>
So, **from the bottom of my heart, thank you**.<br>
