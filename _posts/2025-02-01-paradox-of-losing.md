I can't quite explain why I've been not writing for a while. I guess is the same reasons as always, ***I just don't feel like it***.<br>
I've been kind of dealing with depression and stuff, everything has been difficult for the last year if I'm being honest.<br>
Since February 2024, ***some things happened and somehow changed the balance there used to be in my life***.<br>

It's been a while I've been thinking about all of this, because it's almost a year ***I feel like I'm lost***.<br>
But at the same time during this time, I've won a lot, I've finished college, I've got a great job, I went to Egypt, Dubai, Türkiye, and still I've lost.
And I thought, am I really losing? Or ***am I just being ungrateful for what I have?***<br>

So ***I remembered something*** I have very present in my life since 2015, and maybe I forgot.<br>
***A win is not always a win***, it depends on the context. On what you wanted to achieve and how you wanted to achieve that.<br>
Just as pain, you can't really measure it, because it's subjective, it's personal, it's yours. ***No pain is less valid than other.***<br>

***It's the same way for success or winning***. Let's say you are an Olympic medalist, the best of all, you prepare yourself for the gold and ***you know it is yours***.<br>
But for some reason, unexplainable, you get the silver. So you are devastated, you are destroyed, ***you just lost***.<br>
And the guy with the bronze medal is just euphoric, he just made the greatest achievement of his life. he didn't beat you, but ***still somehow he won, more than you did (?)***.<br>

***It's all about perspective***, and how you see things. And you could be winning, but still is not up to what you expected, so ***you feel like you are losing***.<br>

This takes me to my first point in today's post.

## Parrondo's paradox

In game theory, Parrondo's paradox is a ***combination of two losing strategies*** that results in a winning strategy.<br>

*There exist pairs of games, each with a higher probability of losing than winning, for which it is possible to construct a winning strategy by playing the games alternately.*

Now, this is very logical when it comes to game theory, but ***in real life we can find a way to apply this paradox.***<br>
In 2023, I took a series of decisions that were basically 'losing', lost friends, lost opportunities, lost time.<br>
In that time I was sure that ***all these decisions were necessary in order to eventually win***, to get [something greater](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU6pdNNJM5M).<br>

And in many senses ***I was pretty sure I was going to win***, but almost 2 years later, ***I am just not being lucky***.<br>
I've been losing, and losing, and losing, and I'm just tired of losing.<br>
***I really need a win***.<br>

## Socrates died poisoned, Nietzche died hallucinating, and Baggio died standing

When Roberto Baggio was only 3 years old, he promised his father he would win a world cup for him someday. ***Right after Italy had just lost that one against Brazil***.<br>
In 1994 ***Roberto Baggio played an spectacular world cup***, he was almost the best player of the tournament.<br>
***The final: again Brazil vs Italy.***<br>
It all had to be decided in penalties, Baggio was the last one to kick for Italy. ***If he failed, Brazil would win the world cup***.<br>

Baggio took the shot ***and***... missed the goal. He just stood there in the middle of the field, ***hands on his waist, silence***.<br>

A few days ago, ***I was on the verge of achieving something interesting***, something I have worked for, and the universe knows I've wished for it for a long time.<br>
It felt like it was only necessary one last step, one last step that was not in my hands, ***all I needed was some luck***.<br>
A series of things happened, leading to me standing in the middle of the street, ***rain pouring down on me***, I put my hands on my waist and stood.<br>
***I had lost,*** yet again, and ***all I could remember was Roberto Baggio***.<br>

It wasn't a huge loss, ***it was something I can deal with***, but the fact that it is the n-th consecutive one was just ***devastating***.<br>

Anyway, a friend of mine saw ***I posted a photo of Baggio on WhatsApp***, and sent me this other one:

I immediately understood the message.<br>
After a Brazil 2014, ***there is always a Qatar 2022.***

## Life is a Rollercoaster

***You can't always be high in life.*** it's contradictory, high becomes normal, and nobody wants normal.<br>
You get used to high, you become used to being there, and you need to aim higher, ***because any other way is like losing***.<br>

***Life is a rollercoaster***, and you can't always be high, you can't always be winning, ***you can't always be losing.***<br>
You can't enjoy a rollercoaster in which all there is are the fun and exciting parts, ***you need the slow parts to actually enjoy the rest***.<br>
Just as life, ***you need to be low, to actually value when you are high***.<br>

And I know I must enjoy the ride, cause ***this rollercoaster has an ending***, and I don't want to reach the ending and realize...<br>
*I didn't enjoy the ride.*<br>

I don't believe my life is bad, ***I just want better***, and that's not bad.<br>
But I must be grateful for what I have, because any other way ***I guess I just deserve to keep losing***.<br>

I guess something like that happens to me, ***I've been high for a while***, and now I'm just low or maybe even normal.<br>
But ***I know I'll be high again***, and so will you.<br>

I just need to fail and lose a little more, ***keep playing the game***, and eventually ***things will work out***.<br>
It always works out for me.<br>
### I always win... eventually.

## A little something I need to add

I hate it when wins are remembered for being a win.<br>
I hate it that in real life, ***only winners are remembered.***<br>
Because ***there are valuable losses out there***, great stories and trajectories that didn't end up in a win. Take Baggio for example.<br>
I like writing about my life, because I know I've lost a lot, but ***my stories are amazing***.<br>
And so should everyone, we should all value the losses, ***applaud the courage of the ones that lose bravely***.<br>

***Some losses are worth more than some wins***. And as a Real Madrid anti-fan, I know what I'm talking about.<br>

I know this post had no structure whatsoever, but it's been months I don't write, so it is a good place to start.<br>
Have a great weekend, and remember, ***we are all losers.***
