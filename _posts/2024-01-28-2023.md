Hi, I have been gone for a while. ***A long while.***<br>

To be honest, since the last post, I've sat down many times and started writing or just thinking about all the things 
I want to express, but can't quite get the words to do so.<br>
***I have this post in my head since December 2022***, talking about meritocracy and apparent unfairness in our lives.<br>
But for real, it is really hard to write about it without reaching some stupid conclusions.<br>
So I decided to write ***about 2023 instead***, just to make myself comfortable again expressing myself.<br>

I know I should write about more important or interesting stuff than my life, ***I actually love talking about all the gray areas we have in life***, like for example ___"I understand why you do this, but still I would never justify it"___.<br>
And I swear I will write about all that, I really want to know how people feel about this stuff, and for them to see how I think about it as well.<br>
But for now, ok... my life.

My 2023 was surprisingly, ***the best year of my life***.<br>
After spending MANY years daydreaming about 2016 and all the good things that happened to me that year, 2023 came and said ***"Hold my purse bitch"***.<br>

Allow me to explain. I think the most important thing about making 2023 the best year was mainly attitude.<br>
***My attitude towards myself*** this year was impeccable.

I started 2023 alone in my kitchen, I cooked something nice and that was it. ***All alone***.<br>
I think it was great, because I started the year dealing with something I feared my whole life, loneliness. Cause ***I didn't want to be alone that night, but I had to***.<br>
Cause I never wanted to be alone, but we all have to, eventually.<br>
As I think I explained a year ago, 2022 was awful cause of the loneliness I felt, but 2023 was beautiful because ***I embraced that loneliness***.<br>
I learnt to be by myself. ***I finally defined myself for myself***, without anyone else necessary to establish who I am.<br>

As the first weeks of the year passed, nothing really happened and ***things were going OK***, but somewhere around March I felt like I was starting to feel down, just out of nowhere I felt like ***I was losing myself again*** (If you know what I mean with that, I'm really sorry, and I hope you are better by now).<br>
But this time something weird went through my mind, a thought like "Hey, just let it go". And I know it sounds dumb, but as simple as that I let it go, and I felt better, I was better this time.<br>
Some kind of feeling of power went through my body, and I just knew ***it was in my power to feel better***, to be better.<br>
***I finally could be better for me***, not for someone else or something else, but for me.<br>

I decided to lose weight, because yes.<br> 
And I did so, I started eating healthier, doing exercise daily, and by June ***I had lost around 18Kg*** and became really passionate about jogging.<br>

Uni went smooth from March to June, typical hard courses with stupidly hard topics and weird demonstrations for strange theorems that only crazy mathematicians use, just ***as smooth as it can go in MIPT***.<br>
But as June started I had my GOS (***State Exams for all the courses in my Bachelor's degree***) coming up, so I started to panic.<br>

***I had the hardest and yet the most enjoyable month of exams in my life***.<br>
Together with 3 more friends we reunited every day in a classroom in University, and ***studied all day long***, solving problems, sharing knowledge, sleeping in the desks, eating fast to go back to study.<br>
***Those were amazing 20 days***, I spent full days in that classroom, some days I studied 24 hours nonstop and went home just to take a shower.<br>
I swear, it was an amazing experience. But ***I never want to re-live that.***<br>

***Photo taken at 3:37 am, shows pretty much how every student of MIPT feels during exams month.***<br>
***Whoever this guy is, I get you bro.***

As my exams passed I had just a few days before going back to Bolivia for vacations, this year was special, because ***I had to go to IOI in Szeged - Hungary*** in September, so my plan was to stay in Bolivia until IOI, and from Hungary going back to Russia (That plan failed, but it's not really important for our story).<br>
Back in Bolivia, ***I had a lot of things to think about*** and make some ***big decisions*** for my life.<br>

I started by speaking to my parents and telling them that, ***I didn't want to do a Master's degree***. And that went well!<br>

So I continued my quest, and told an old and beloved friend ***I couldn't stay in their life***, as it was holding me back from moving on with my own life.<br>

I kept going and made the decision that ***I want to go back to Bolivia***, because every person I love lives there, and when the time comes and they have to leave, ***It will be alright***.<br> *Other options I had were to go to USA and find my way there, or going back to Argentina, were I feel I could be happy as well.*

And finally, out of complete luck or something, ***I started the most serious relationship*** I ever had. [Just like that](https://youtu.be/pvP_OwVSFpk?si=D8p1zZBWzTSkyv2l).<br>
It's funny, I spent more than a year learning to be alone, to be a better person, and I spent the first months of my 2023 planning how to move on with my life after graduating. And all of the sudden, ***I found the person*** I think(I hope) will be my partner for life.<br>
I must add, of course, it wasn't out of nowhere, I had known her for more than a year by that point, and I was already pretty crazy about her, ***I just didn't expect to fall for her this way***.

My time in Bolivia was amazing, ***watching all my friends succeeding in their lives was simply beautiful***.<br> 

My time in Szeged was also amazing, and therapeutic, ***I love IOI*** and Olympiads in Informatics, I dedicated big part of my time organizing them since 2019.<br>
As I started my time at IOI, ***it felt like it was my first of many as Leader***. I got the opportunity to get closer to this young guys, who trained so hard to be there, and ***I value very much the opportunity to have been there with them***.<br>
But as my time passed, ***it actually felt like a farewell***. Like it was the universe(causality) giving me the chance to say goodbye to something I love so deeply.<br>
I certainly hope to go back to IOI next year, but even if it was on my hands to decide so; I'm not sure whether I'm the right person for the job.<br>
***I will for sure talk about IOI in another post.***

After my time in Szeged, ***I had to go back to Bolivia***. To spend a few more days with my friends and family.<br>
I threw a ***party with my closest friends***, which I certainly enjoyed. And plan to repeat with even more people next year for my graduation.<br>

***And the goodbye, was just hard.*** Saying goodbye to my girlfriend, to my friends.<br>
To go back to Russia, but this time without many of my close friends to rely on (*As 3 of them left inadvertently, and one finished his degree*).

But once back here, time just passed.<br>
***Nothing interesting happened*** between September and New Year's (Besides Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer, of course).<br>
I had so much free time, ***I started working on myself again***, learning stuff by myself, reading a lot, playing GTA Online and RDR 2.
But besides that, time flew all the way to this exact point in time. With me writing this.<br>

***I take 2023 as the best year of my life***, because it was a year in which I took control of my own life, which is never easy.<br>
Having control of your own life is hard, there are so many things you can't control and will just mess with you. But this year ***I was lucky***, and I was able to set a path I really want to follow.<br>

2023 for me was way ***beyond all the good stuff***, good stuff that I can encapsulate in just a few days of the year.<br>
***2023 was about ignoring the bad stuff***, about keeping calm under stress, and ***making the hard decisions even when they hurt the most***.<br>
***2023 was about making peace with the ghosts*** that I had let haunt me for years. And going back to those places that required revisiting, just to say ***GOODBYE***.

I know ***it will be damn hard from here***, but if it's not hard it's just not fun.<br>
***I have the right company***, because if I learnt something this year. Is that:<br>
***With the right people, even when you're alone, you are never alone.***<br>

As always, ***thanks for reading***.<br>  
I hope you also had ***an amazing year***.<br>
Please take care.<br>
Your friend, ***Diego Angulo***.

***Pd.*** *It turns out, I will actually do a Master's degree, but it's because the stars aligned and I have the chance to do it online.*
