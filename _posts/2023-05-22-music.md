__Picture this:__ is Friday morning, you are completely distracted while on a Complex Analysis class, and suddenly you think "Which is my favorite album to listen to?", obviously the first answer that came to my mind was ___"Memories do not open, duuh"___.<br>

But, is it? Do I like that much "Memories do not open"? Or is it just the fact that I listened to it a lot during 2017 because I was heartbroken?<br>
So initially I checked every Chainsmokers album, and realized that the album I most enjoyed was definitely __"Sick Boy"__, because of the timing of the album and the topic of itself.<br>
BUT, the one I could hear nonstop for the rest of my life is __"World War Joy"__.<br>
So, which of these 3 is my favorite Chainsmokers album? The one that helped me the most, the one I most enjoyed or the one I still most enjoy?<br>

That question will be answered today, ***at the end of this post***!

Ok, I know that introduction was a total audience killer.<br>
___"Ugh, a post about a pair of DJs I don’t even know? pass..."___<br>
No, this post is about ___the music I love___, and why I love it, so yes... now you can leave, cause absolutely no one cares about this. But still.<br> 
***I find it funny***, and creative idea to analyze, or for people to analyze me.

So, this is a simple post, no structure actually...<br>
I'll just list my ***favorite albums***, ***songs*** and ***artists*** and explain why. And that's it.<br>
If you also love any of those, ***feel free to become my best friend*** <3<br>

## Artists

| **Airbag** |
|<img src="/assets/img/music_post/airbag.jpeg" width="250" height="180" class="center"><br>|
|I listen to Airbag since I was a little boy, playing with chalk while listening to Radio Disney.<br>But it was not until 2022 when I returned to their music, and daaamn ***I MISSED THEM***.<br>Is it rock? Pop? Soft rock? I don't care, it is magical...<br>Their songs go from "___I've lost, we've lost___" to "___I am living a fucking dream you will never reach___".<br>Songs that take you down with phrases like "___Sometimes I fool myself, by reading old books that say the good ones win___", but they also have songs so crazy like "___I'll just party, I'm freaking crazy___".<br>Most of their music brings you down, but they give you some hope, and it's just so artistic... <br>I can't choose my favorite song, but this one is pure Airbag: [Por mil noches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdfkr1WEzIc)|

|**Bastille**|
|<img src="/assets/img/music_post/bastille.jpg" width="250" height="180" class="center"><br>|
|Bastille and the next group are just pure comfort for me.<br>I met them when they released ___"Pompeii"___, and I declared myself a fan when listened to ___"Glory"___<br>These guys simply are magical, they create such melodies, I don't really know if I can say they have a style...<br>Their lyrics can talk about so many things, and their covers! ___OMG THEIR COVERS.___<br>Listening to their music is simply a break from the world, a moment to disappear and sing, to feel... __Feel their music.__<br><br>I love you Dan Smith.<br>[Icarus - Bastille](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdfkr1WEzIc)|
|**Of Monsters and Men**|
|<img src="/assets/img/music_post/OMAM.jpg" width="250" height="180" class="center"><br>|
|I remember I only liked [one of their songs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghb6eDopW8I), and I didn't find anything interesting on their music in general.<br>Until one day, when I was sad and depressed as hell, I decided to listen to ["Yellow light"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBlKPLeLU_s).<br>I cried my heart out while listening to such magical melody. And once the song was over, it was all gone.<br>I listened a couple more songs and fell in love, all of their songs are an ___emotional journey___.<br>Each song is so strong and ___makes you feel like you're alive!___ <br>Each song takes you by the hand and whispers to you ___"It's all ok".___<br><br>When everything is lost, I just stop and listen to Of Monsters and Men...|
|**Kygo**|
|<img src="/assets/img/music_post/kygo.jpg" width="230" height="230" class="center"><br>|
|Ok, I don't consider myself a great Kygo fan, I like his music and I listen to all of his songs.<br>I've never felt like he is an artist I love, but apparently...<br>___Kygo is the artist I listen to the most since 2019___, according to Youtube and Spotify stats.<br>When I found out about this I was surprised, and checking the facts...<br>___There is not a Kygo's song I dislike___, I have all of his songs in my playlists, absolutely all of them, no exaggeration.<br><br>So, I can't say there is a reason, but it seems like [I love Kygo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vusqQJ56iIM).|
|**The Chainsmokers**|
|<img src="/assets/img/music_post/alex_drew.webp" width="330" height="240" class="center"><br>|
|I love The Chainsmokers as much as my own life, actually they are on the 3 sections of this post.<br>The Chainsmokers '*saved my life*', twice actually.<br>I was never suicidal, but I was very depressed and in a dark place in my life during 2017 and parts of 2018-2019.<br>In 2017 their music was a good company too keep my head busy, but in 2018 ___it was just perfect___.<br><br>At all time, their music from sad, to rave senseless mixes, just makes me feel like my life has a meaning.<br>[Thank you Alex and Drew, thank you forever.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mWQ38SpEf8)|

| **[Sick Boy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eACohWVwTOc)** <img src="/assets/img/music_post/sick-boy.png"> | I love every album from The Chainsmokers, I love every one of their songs, but for me:<br><br>Sick Boy is the complete experience, I feel identified with almost all of the songs in the album, I lived the album throughout a part of my life in which I needed this album... And gosh.<br><br>After all this time...<br>***I just wanna drink Tequila with my friends...***<br>***They're the reason that I still am who I am***|

## And songs...
Just this one small section and that's it.
I just want to mention 10 songs, 10 songs that beyond the artist or the album or anything, ***I will always treasure and listen to***.<br>

| **[Closer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT2_F-1esPk)** - The song that started everything... for them, and for me. Thanks to this song, we all listened to The Chainsmokers at least once. |
| [Tompkins Square Park](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfBVDHT2l0w) - This song gives me the chills, makes me feel scared but hopeful, I dream about finding my soulmate. But this song seems to tell me ***"She will come, but as she comes, she'll go..."***<br>***No flame burns forever, and most don't even last the night.*** |
|[Safe and Sound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47dtFZ8CFo8) - This song is my absolute favorite, it makes me happy, it makes me remember good old days, it makes me feel like...<br>***We're safe and sound***|
|[Rivers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqYEvGr372M) and [Hymn For The Weekend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YykjpeuMNEk) - These two songs go together, cause in a tense moment, just minutes ago competing for last time in a National Olympiad in Bolivia, both made me feel calm and gave me the strength [to win](/2022/07/16/contestant-BOL1.html).|
|[These Days](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjTj-_55WZ8) - ***I hope someday we'll sit down together, and laugh with each other about these days*** \*cries\* |
|[Dias](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAHYQqqnHv8) - Te amo Coti, gracias por los rolones, gracias por la nostalgia... Gracias por ***los recuerdos del pasado***.|
|[Best I can](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9TbNKSN44g) - You'll just have to listen if you need to know why I feel this song as mine.|
|[Remedy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nfrz2UpI3jk) - ***Live young, die fast... That's the remedy for everything.***|
|[Solo le pido a Dios](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTZb_LStL-0) - When I listen to this song ***I can only think of my dad singing***. He used to play this song in his car. <br>He used to work as a door-to-door doctor in Buenos Aires and sometimes I had to go with him, all those afternoons being absolutely bored by his side, but still creating these valuable memories, ***those were the days***...<br> ***Te amo viejo.***|

And yeah, that's it...<br>
Again I don't actually expect no one to read this post.<br> So obviously I don't expect no one to listen to my music.<br>
But ***it was nice sharing*** with you guys and girls...<br>

I'll keep posting soon, have a nice one <3
